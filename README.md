I'm just rambling incoherently, so well just ignore it~

I drank bourbon today, it was delicious.. really, an American whiskey:3
my friend invited me to a fucking bar
I went and had fun.. maybe
oh I forgot to send my work report, I'm stupid
I was scolded:/
"nooo more drinking! blah, blah-" tf, your life is so serious. i just want to please myself, y'know?
I might go back to Indonesia in 2 years, maybe I can find a partner here hehe~
I am very lucky to have friends here, oh including my fortune. thank you, Jesus..
but i will miss my mamaðŸ¥º
